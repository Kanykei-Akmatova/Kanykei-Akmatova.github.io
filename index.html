      coordinator, event planner. However, when I reflect on the past 20 years
      cultivating skills in management, project management, planning and
      communication.I realize that my passion comes from working with

      I adapt quickly to new environments and thrive on multiple tasks. I
      receive no greater joy than being driven by my curiosity. I thrive when I
      come up with a simple creative solution to solve a complex issue. I like
      engineering order out of chaos.
